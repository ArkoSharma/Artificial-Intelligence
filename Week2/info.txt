The problem has been implemented using the logic as follows :



1. There are two classes - one for the road-network and other for the vehicles.
   The necessary properties required for the problem are maintained as attributes of the respective classes.
   

2. The network has the connectivity stored as an adj matrix and maintains a load-matrix having the current number
   of vehicles in each road.

   In this setting an event takes place when a vehicle leaves a particular road
   and enters a different road. The transition between roads is instantaneous.

   A Priority Queue is used to find out which event takes place next. This queue is initialized with the starting times
   of the vehicles. Every time a transition occurs ,  the "Event" member function is executed.
   
   This function removes the vehicle which is to be relocated from the queue, modifies the parameters
   of the vehicle, calculates the time for next departure and inserts it back into the queue.In case the vehicle has
   completed its journey,it is not re-inserted into the queue.  

      
3.Each vehicle has a numeric id, departure time, a count of the roads it has travelled and the
  sequence of vertices which constitutes its predefined path. 
  
  The Vehicle class implements an Update function to redefine the parameters as needed and a comparator that
  enables sorting by the "departure-time" attribute.
  
4.The Event function of the network is executed until all the vehicles complete their jouney.At this point, the queue becomes
  empty for the first time since beginning and program exits.
