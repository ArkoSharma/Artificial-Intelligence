The problem has been implemented using the logic as follows :



1. There are two classes - one for the grid environment and other for the moving agent.
   The necessary properties required for the problem are maintained as attributes of the
   respective classes.
   

2. The grid has the locations of the agent and the destination blocks as state variables.
   Also it records the number of steps moved by the agent.
 
   The environment has an utility function "reward" to which returns 1 if the agent
   reaches the goal state and 0 for every other move.

      
3. The agent moves randomly in one of the 6 cardinal directions in 3-dimensions.
   The move is generated randomly with numpy's random generator and passed to the
   environment, which checks if it is legal or not and modifies the coordinates of
   the agent accordingly.

4. The problem is solved for a number of cases and finally the mean and the variance
   are returned.
