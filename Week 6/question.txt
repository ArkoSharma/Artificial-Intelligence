Search Techniques.

1. For the first problem create a grid with starting position at the lower left corner and ending position in the upper right.
   The grid should contain some blocked cells ( diagonally oriented ) .

2. Run BFS with 4 actions (Left,Right,Up,Down) on the grid and report the number of steps required to reach the goal.
   Modify and compare number of steps with 8 actions - allowing diagonal movements.

3. Secondly run A* with two different heuristics : the Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance and report the number of steps
   required to search the goal cell.
