Problem 2 ::
------------------
        
 Environment is defined by 4 state variables :

	loc_x , loc_y     : static location of dirty block
	agent_x , agent_y : location of agent 


 The agent class has 2 states : 
	
	  x_steps : no of x moves to make
	  y_steps : no of y moves to make  

 Traversal :

	1. The agent moves along the perimeter of a square to look for the destination.
	   The length of a side of square is measured by the number of blocks( grids ) per side.
	2. Once a cycle is complete, the length of square is incremented by 2 blocks.
	   The newly formed square just bounds the earlier square.
	3. Initial length ( no of grids along the side ) of the square is 1.
	   It starts at the initial location of the cleaner agent.
      	   It is a complete cycle by itself.

Problem 3 ::
--------------------
Class WordID has 1 state variable that indicates whether the current character is a
starting of a word or not. If the current character is the starting of a word,
and the current state indicates that no word is currently running, then the counter is incremented by 1 .Additionally the state is set to indicate a word is currently running.
In all other cases , the counter is not incremented and the state is set
to indicate that no word is running.


The definition of word used here is a group of english alphabets with no other 
special characters in between . Any other character is used as a delimiter.
