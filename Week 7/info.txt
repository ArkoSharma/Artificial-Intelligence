Problem 1 
 
        This problem uses A-star search to look for the least-time path between a given starting state and
        a given goal state . There are two modes of transportation : bus (for which a budget is given that 
        cannot be exceeded ) and a cycle. The speeds of bus and cycle are fixed and vary according to the congestion
        that is given as an input.

        Firstly, all the road distances are known as weights of a graph that represents the road network.
        Using these distances, we run shortest path algorithm from all nodes of the graph as sources and the goal as the target.
        
        Now, we run A-star algorithm with the precomputed shortest distances as the heuristic function.
