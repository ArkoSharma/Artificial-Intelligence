Lab 5 :: ( n-squared minus 1 puzzle ) - Solution using BFS
         
"""



In this problem, we use BFS to solve the N^2 - 1 puzzle.

This is a challenging problem in many ways : 
   
   1. Firstly, the search space grows exponentially and so does the amount of memory required to
      keep track of the visited states. It is obvious that leaving the visited states untracked 
      would lead to an enormous time complexity.
      
      To deal with this problem, we do not begin with a fully random puzzle, instead
      we make sure that the number of actual steps to reach the goal is not beyond a certain theshold.
   
   2. Secondly since it is tedious to manually look at the boards during BFS, we hash each board
      by concatenating the digits in row-major order in form of a string such that 'a' is 1,
      'b' is 2.. and so on.
      The board
      
      1 2
      3 4
      
      is thus represented as "abcd".It is easy to see that such a string would give a unique hashcode
      for each board-state as long as the dimension <= 5. This is suitable for our problem. 
      
   3. Now we run a regular BFS and return the shortest path when we reach the goal for the first time.
